          *eMart Cancellation Policy* We understand that situations may arise
          where you need to cancel an order placed on eMart. To ensure a smooth

          please follow these steps: 1. Log in to your eMart account. 2. Go to
          "My Orders" and locate the order you want to cancel. 3. Click on the
          "Cancel Order" button next to the order. 4. Confirm your cancellation
          request. Please note that orders cannot be canceled once they have

          an order, such as changing the shipping address or adding or removing
          items, please contact us within 24 hours of placing the order. We will
